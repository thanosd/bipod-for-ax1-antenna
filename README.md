3D printed bipod for Elecraft's AX1 antenna

## Notes

This is a simple 3D printed mount for the Electraft AX1.  

When inserting the antenna into the grip, push the grip up from the bottom of the antenna, 
as the antenna is a bit thinner on the bottom. It's a snug fit.

You can use M3 screws, about 18-20mm long to attach the logs to the main grip.

* Requires the BOSL OpenSCAD library, which you can get from here:  https://github.com/revarbat/BOSL
* Sometimes the joiners stop rendering. Flushing the OpenSCAD cache seems to fix that.
